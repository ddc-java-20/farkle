## Overview

### ðŸŽ² Farkle: The Ultimate Turn-Based Dice Game App

Imagine a fast-paced, competitive dice game you can play anytime, anywhereâ€”with friends or solo. This Farkle app brings the classic risk-and-reward gameplay to your phone, featuring asynchronous play so you can take turns at your convenience. Use round time limits to keep the game engaging, without dragging on. Challenge friends, join random matches, or play solo to sharpen your strategy. Roll, strategize, and win!

Farkle â€” This game will use the main ruleset of Farkle and implement asynchronous play through a web service (with time limits to keep games moving).

Example Session

### Startup

Login: Choose a display name on first play, with option to change later

Select number of players (with potential expansion to custom group sizes and solitaire mode)

Start a game session

Watch other players' turns on screen while waiting for your turn (turn-based gameplay)

Take your turn: Roll dice, select scoring combinations, bank points (or bust)

Continue rounds until someone reaches the winning score

View post-game summary showing winner and point rankings

Settings screen to select score goal (10,000, 15,000, etc.) â€” players must match with others choosing the same point target - likely a stretch goal and initial game would be original 10,000 point

Help screen with Farkle rules and scoring guide

### Gameplay challenges/fun
Random number generation for dice rolls
Dynamic removal of scoring dice between rolls - subsequent rolls would have -the number of dice pulled, end of round would need scoring and bust condition.

### Webservice
This game has a service to keep track of a game in progress, take users scores and pass the round to the next player after the previous player completes, etc
The core game should support some kind of solitaire mode. Despite this, a solitaire mode could be strange and repetitive, without opponents scoring, so the ability to play with others via webservice should be considered the primary goal.
