## Overview

Imagine a fast-paced, competitive dice game you can play anytime, anywhere. This Farkle app brings
the classic risk-and-reward gameplay to your phone, featuring asynchronous play so you can take 
turns at your convenience. Use round time limits to keep the game engaging, without dragging on.


**Farkle** â€” This game will use the main ruleset and scoring of Farkle and implement asynchronous
play through a web service (with time limits to keep games moving).

## External services and data sources

**Google Identity Services**
- Service Name: Google Identity Services
- [Google identity services overview](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview)
- Usage: Google Identity Services will be used for user authentication in the Farkle app. It allows users to log in with their Google accounts, ensuring a secure and convenient authentication process. By integrating this service, we can associate users with their desired game names and, in future releases, track score rankings, user preferences, communication methods, and preferred opponents.
- Impact of Interruption: If Google Identity Services is unavailable, users will not be able to log in to the Farkle application, rendering the app inaccessible for gameplay.

**Digital Ocean Droplets**
- Service Name: Digital Ocean Droplets
- [Digital Ocean Droplets Product Page](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets)
- Usage: Digital Ocean Droplets will be utilized as the backend infrastructure for the Farkle application. It will host the database and web server, managing the business logic and web services required for the app's functionality. Droplets provide a scalable and reliable environment for running the application's backend.
- Impact of Interruption: If Digital Ocean Droplets are unavailable, the Farkle application will not function, as the backend services and database will be inaccessible, preventing users from playing the game.
